### **1. Offensive Security & Penetration Testing**

### **Web & Network Penetration Testing**

- **Identified and exploited common vulnerabilities** (SQL Injection, RCE, SSRF, XXE) in web applications using **manual testing and automated tools** like **Burp Suite, Nmap, and Nikto**.
- **Conducted network penetration testing** by **exploiting misconfigurations, weak credentials, and privilege escalation vectors** in controlled environments.
- Applied **post-exploitation techniques** to **maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and simulate real-world attack scenarios**.

### **Wireless & Social Engineering Attacks**

- **Captured and cracked WPA2 handshakes** using **Aircrack-ng, Hashcat, and Fluxion** to test wireless network security.
- Developed a **custom Evil Twin Attack Captive Portal** using **dnsmasq, hostapd, and phishing webpages** to **demonstrate credential harvesting techniques**.
- Created and executed **phishing simulation campaigns** using **Gophish and Evilginx**, analyzing **attack effectiveness and bypassing 2FA protections** in lab environments.

### **2. Cloud Security & Compliance**

### **AWS Security & Compliance Implementation**

- **Implemented security controls based on PCI DSS guidelines** to ensure compliance in AWS cloud environments.
- **Configured least-privilege IAM policies, VPC security controls, network ACLs, and logging mechanisms** to prevent unauthorized access and enforce security best practices.

### **Automated Compliance Checks with AWS Config**

- **Developed custom AWS Config rules** to **automate security compliance checks**, ensuring resources met predefined security standards.
- **Integrated AWS Lambda for automated remediation**, marking resources as **compliant or non-compliant** based on policy enforcement.

### **Cloud Logging & Threat Detection**

- **Set up AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and CloudWatch** for **real-time security monitoring and auditing**.
- **Integrated ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** to **analyze logs, detect anomalies, and identify potential security threats**.

### **3. Automation & Infrastructure Security**

### **Hardening Kubernetes Clusters**

- **Applied CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmarking** to **harden Kubernetes deployments** and **enforce security best practices**.
- **Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **network policies** to **restrict unauthorized access** in multi-tenant environments.
- **Enhanced container security** using **runtime security measures, pod security policies, and monitoring tools**.

### **Security Automation with Python & Ansible**

- **Developed Python-based automation scripts** for **log analysis, vulnerability scanning, and security event correlation**.
- **Used Ansible to automate system hardening, configuration management, and security patching** across cloud and on-prem environments.
- **Implemented infrastructure as code (IaC) security** with **Terraform, AWS security policies, and automated compliance checks**.
